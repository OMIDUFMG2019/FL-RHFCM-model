# FL-RHFCM-model
This repository contains the code for a novel decentralized univariate time series forecasting technique called FL-RHFCM which integrates the principles of Randomized High-order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (R-HFCM)
with Federated Learning (FL) to predict traffic. R-HFCM is akin to an echo state network (ESN), where the only trainable component is the output layer using least squares (LS) minimization. The reservoir layerâ€™s weights are initialized randomly and remain unchanged during training. Thus, the LS coefficients represent the only parameters shared with the server for aggregation in our FL-RHFCM approach. FL-RHFCM introduces an efficient distributed forecasting method using FCMs, significantly reducing communication costs. The effectiveness of our proposed model is assessed using two datasets, demonstrating its promise compared to some existing baseline methods.
